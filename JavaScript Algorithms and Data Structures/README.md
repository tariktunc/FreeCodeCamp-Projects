# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains the five projects required to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. Each project is designed to reinforce my skills in JavaScript through practical applications of algorithms and data structures. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## Palindrome Checker

This project checks whether a string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward, ignoring case sensitivity, punctuation, and spacing. It demonstrates the ability to manipulate and compare strings in JavaScript.

## Roman Numeral Converter

This application converts a given number into a Roman numeral. It takes a number from the user and returns its Roman numeral equivalent as a string. This project aims to enhance understanding of number systems conversion and string manipulation skills.

## Caesars Cipher

In this project, a string is encrypted using the Caesar Cipher technique, a type of substitution cipher. It encrypts a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number. This offers an in-depth practice of cryptography and string manipulation.

## Telephone Number Validator

This application checks if a given phone number is in a valid US phone number format. It supports various formats (e.g., with parentheses, spaces, hyphens) and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a valid phone number.

## Cash Register

This project simulates a cash register application. Given the total price and cash given, it calculates the change due to the customer using the least number of coins and bills. This is an excellent practice for mathematical problem-solving and object-oriented programming skills.
