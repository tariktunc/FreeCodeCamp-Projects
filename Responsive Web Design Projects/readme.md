This repository contains the 5 projects I completed for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries certification. Each project utilizes Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React, and Redux to showcase my front end development skills. These projects are meticulously designed to reinforce and practically test everything I've learned so far.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate how various applications can be created using modern web development tools and libraries. Working on these projects has been a significant learning experience for me, showing that I have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to earn the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries certification.
